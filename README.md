# What's special?
1. One quiz providing immediate feedback to the user once an answer is chosen #JS
2. One quiz scores and returns the grade after the every question is answered #JS

# Closure
Script was my second project this year. I can see the way my skills have grown
especially when it comes to responsive design. With Use of frameworks and better
tools, I am sure I can make awesome web experiences in the future.
## My growth points were mainly that I:
- Am talented more in design and front-end.
- Need to practice JavaScript and PHP more.
- Need to further polish my work processes and start exploring ways to design
and organize the code itself in a way that will make it more maintainable and
re-usable in the future.
